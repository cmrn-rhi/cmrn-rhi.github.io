**Abstract:** The sequencing and sharing of viral genomes and associated contextual data has been a significant challenge for the public health SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response. DataHarmonizer was developed to address this need and improve data quality. It is a secure, template-driven JavaScript spreadsheet application that runs in a browser locally. It utilizes an ontology driven data specification, facilitating the creation of interoperable and comparable datasets from disparate sources across Canada.
