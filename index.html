<h1>Hi, my name is Rhiannon.</h1>
<p>
    I completed my Bachelor of Science in Microbiology at the University of Victoria
    in 2019 and am currently a MSc student in the Department of Bioinformatics at
    the University of British Columbia under the supervision of Dr. William Hsiao with the 
    Centre for Infectious Disease Genomics and One Health.

    My current work involves ontology curation and development for outbreak investigation 
    and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 for the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN).
    I am also interested in bioinformatics, computational biology, public health, and
    UX design.
</p>
<p>
    While my background is mostly in data analysis, I have always dabbled in
    computer science and am now focusing on improving my programming skills.
    My code is public on
    <a href="https://github.com/cmrn-rhi" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
