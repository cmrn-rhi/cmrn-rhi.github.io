<h1>Hi, my name is Rhiannon.</h1>
<p>
    I completed my Bachelor of Science in Microbiology at the University of Victoria
    in 2019 and am currently a PhD graduate student in the Faculty of Health
    Sciences at Simon Fraser University under the supervision of Dr. William Hsiao with
    the Centre for Infectious Disease Genomics and One Health (cidgoh.ca).

<p>
    My thesis work involves ontology curation and development for outbreak investigation 
    and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 for the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN).
    I am expanding my thesis work to focus on specification development and
    ontology modeling of risk assessment in food borne pathogen surveillance for the
    Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Canadian Genomics Research and Development Initiative (GRDI).
    I am also interested in bioinformatics, computational biology, public health, and UX design.

    While my background is mostly in data analysis, I have always dabbled in
    computer science and am enjoy cultivating my programming skills.
    My code is public on
