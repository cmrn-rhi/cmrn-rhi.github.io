<h1>Hi, my name is Rhiannon.</h1>
<p>
    I am a Microbiology Major from UVIC interested in
    computation biology and bioinformatics.
    Check out my <a href="/RCameron_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.

<p>
    I am currently in the process of applying to UBC Master's in
    Bioinformatics program under the supervision of Dr. William Hsiao with the 
    Public Health Bioinformatics Laboratory at the BC Centre for Disease Control.

    While my background is mostly in data analysis, I have always dabbled in
    computer science and am now focusing on improving my programming skills.
    My code is public on
