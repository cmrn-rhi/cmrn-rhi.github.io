<h1>Hi, my name is Rhiannon.</h1>
<p>
    I am a Microbiology Major from UVIC looking for intership opportunities
    in computation biology and bioinformatics.
    Check out my <a href="/RCameron_CV (v6.5).pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I intend to apply to the 2020 UBC/SFU Master's in Bioinformatics program.
</p>
<p>

    While my background is mostly in data analysis, I have always dabbled in
    computer science and am now focusing on improving my programming skills.
    My code is public on
    <a href="https://github.com/cmrn-rhi" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The best ways to contact me are
    <a href="mailto:cmrn.rhi@gmail.com?subject=Hi there!" target="_blank">email</a> and
