<h1>Hi, my name is Rhiannon.</h1>
<p>
    I am a Microbiology Major from UVIC interested in
    bioinformatics, computational biology, and UX design.
    Check out my <a href="/RCameron_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
</p>
<p>
    September 2020 I will be beginning the UBC Bioinformatics Master's
    program under the supervision of Dr. William Hsiao with the 
    Public Health Bioinformatics Laboratory at the BC Centre for Disease Control.
</p>
<p>
    While my background is mostly in data analysis, I have always dabbled in
    computer science and am now focusing on improving my programming skills.
    My code is public on
    <a href="https://github.com/cmrn-rhi" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
